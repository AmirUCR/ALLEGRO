# Integer value, default: 0
beta: 0  # The final size of the gRNAs set must be <= than this. Think of it as your budget.
          # Setting to 0 disables beta and causes ALLEGRO to find the smallest gRNA set IGNORING scores
          # (treats all of the gRNAs as equals).

          # the number of species you have (worst case, one gRNA per species).
          # If set to a number HIGHER than the number of species, finds the best #beta gRNAs.
