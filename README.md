# Introduction
ALLEGRO is a synthetic biology tool leveraging linear programming to design the smallest possible gRNA library which satisfies certain constraints.

- Design a Cas9 gRNA library for thousands of species simultaneously
- Flexible library design using an ensemble of options such as tracks, multiplicity, pre- and post-clustering, and more
- Extremely fast and computationally efficient
